The goal of this project is near 100% accuracy, never miss an intruder but avoid false positives in challenging environments and circumstances. 
  
Tested with Foscam FI9853EP outdoor IP camera's.
  
- leverages camera build in movement detection algorithm to trigger the Neural Network analysis, this to reduce power consumption.
- every suspicious movement is analyzed by a Neural Network (yolov3) which filters the false positives and only triggers when the objects of interest are actually seen (like a person, cat)
  

### Dependencies
- make dependencies

  
#### BUILD
- install opencv4
- make
 

### Run  
./aiintruder -c /conf/aiintruder.cfg<br>
  
 
### Email notifications  
see: notify.sh  
 - sudo apt install ssmtp
  

### Raspberry PI 3B+
Aiintruder is tested on on a raspberry PI 3B+

| Algorithm   | Memory  | Decode JPEG |
|-------------|---------|-------------| 
|Yolo v3      | ~560 MB | ~12 Sec     | 
|Yolo v3 tiny | ~160 MB | ~2 Sec      | 

### Todo
- integrate vdecoder an make it build-optional, like on Raspberry PI only Jpegs are used to save resources.  
- notifications take about 2 seconds with my ISP, take this out of the frameanalyzer loop

Apply Neural Network Techology to outdoor Security camera video streams.


The goal of this project is 100% accuracy, never miss an intruder but avoid false positives in challenging environments. 

Tested with Foscam FI9853EP outdoor IP camera's.

- leverages camera build in movement detection algorithm to trigger the NN, this reduces power consumption
- every suspicious movement is analyzed by a Neural Network which filters the false positives and only triggers
  when the objects of interest are actually seen (like a person, cat)

The goal of this project is near 100% accuracy, never miss an intruder but avoid false positives in challenging environments and circumstances. 
  
Tested with Foscam FI9853EP outdoor IP camera's.
  
- leverages camera build in movement detection algorithm to trigger the Neural Network analysis, this to reduce power consumption.
- every suspicious movement is analyzed by a Neural Network which filters the false positives and only triggers when the objects of interest are actually seen (like a person, cat)
